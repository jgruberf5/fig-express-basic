# Express Hello World for the f5-icontrol-gateway

This template application is the minimal project required to publish an express app as an nginx unit application into the [f5-icontrol-gateway](https://hub.docker.com/r/jgruberf5/f5-icontrol-gateway) container.

It contains the simplest possible node express application in the `app.js` file.

There are two wrapper scripts for the `app.js` application, `index.js` which runs the application locally, and `unitapp.js` which is intended to run your application in the nginx unit application server.

The `unit_config.conf` file provides the needed route and application information for nginx unit to add a URI namespace for your application.

## Run Your Application Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Build Your f5-icontrol-gateway Application Container

```bash
npm install
docker build -t fig-express-basic .
```

## Run Your f5-icontrol-gateaway Application

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8443:443 --name fig-express-basic fig-express-basic:latest
```

You should then be able to access your application at:

[https://localhost:8443/fig-express-app](https://localhost:8443/fig-express-app)
